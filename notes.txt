Notes:
1) Opting not to pass whole arraylist of transactions as a bundle to the new fragment,
I don't know how big that list could get, there is a limit to how much data could be passed
in bundles.

2) Decided to make network call to transactions after sign in, account balance is passed over,
this is also a better solution because i'm not overloading the first signin api

3) I don't see nicely documented apis too often, this was refreshing

4) ViewModels and networking repository are separate from other classes which makes these classes
easily testable

5) Used toasts instead of Logs so you can see network responses

Issues:
6) I picked the first graph api i saw on github, but it had quite a few limitations
a) x axis only accepts double or full timestamp, so I just assigned a double instead of
assigning the full timestamp (the method to convert is listed in extensions.kt)
b) graph viewport can't refocused
